                    <p>
                        The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune
500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that
helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any
business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the
                        world's largest communities teaching young minds about how
                        to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new
                        world of opportunities.

                <p>
                    As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
                    that's holding you back is yourself.
                </p>

                <p>

                    You've already gone through the hardest parts being a
                    developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader
                    in something you're passionate about.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help
your company.
